#GitHub Basics Exercise

1. The terminal is a manual tool used to instruct a computer to perform certain tasks rather than a traditional GUI (Graphical User Interface) Application.
2. The major difference between Git and Github is that Git has a local repository and Github has a remote (online) repository. Also, Github has a GUI (Graphical User Interface) where as Git is used in the terminal (no fancy buttons just plain text).
3. When you're on a Github repository, in the top right corner you will find "fork". Click it. Under "owner" select yourself as the owner. Name your repository. Add a description. Select whether or not you would like to copy the main branch. Click create a fork. The repository should now be forked as a repository on your profile. Forking clones the repository that was originally forked.
